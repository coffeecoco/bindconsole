This console will allow a user that has this script as loginshell or is
allowed to execute it via sudo as unprivileged user (see documentation!) to edit parts
of the configuration of a BIND nameserver to add secondary zones, remove them and change their configuration.

Currently a lot of functionality is still missing!

Work in progress!
